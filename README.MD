# Artificial Tree Soil - A Mod for Factorio Space Age

Normally argicultural towers can only plant tree seeds on grass. This mod adds artificial tree soil. This soil works exactly as the other artificial soils, but creates grass tiles in which trees can grow. When using enough artificial tree soil and agricultural towers on Nauvis you might even be able to neutralize your polution on Nauvis!
